# Building ‘Shiny’ Web Applications In R

*Shiny is a framework for developing interactive, web-based tools with R. This workshop will cover how to create a basic user interface, add reactive widgets and publish a Shiny app. No web development experience is required. Some familiarity with R will be helpful.*

## Introduction

Shiny is a light-weight web application framework. What does that mean? 

Shiny might be the right tool if:

- You want to execute R code dynamically based on user input

You might be better off using something other than Shiny if:

- You need to create a website with lots of users
- You need to create a native mobile app


It's built to run code written in R, and is maintained by RStudio. There's really robust documentation and plenty of resources both for beginners and advanced Shiny developers:

- [Collection of posts covering the basics of layout, reactivity and extensions for Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/)
- [RStudio 'cheatsheet' for Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf)

## 'Bones' of a Shiny App

Like we mentioned above, Shiny is developed by RStudio. So it's no suprise that the RStudio IDE has some features
